   - Main tests
   - Topology tests
   - Inference engine tests

2. **hanzo-mcp testing**:
   - Basic functionality
   - E2E integration with hanzo-network
   - Local AI inference

3. **Integration testing**:
   - Import verification
   - E2E demo execution
   - Cross-package functionality

4. **Code quality**:
   - Linting with ruff
   - Formatting checks with black

5. **Summary reporting**:

   - Component health checks

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Run all tests locally
cd /Users/z/work/hanzo/python-sdk
./run_all_tests.sh

# Test E2E local inference
cd pkg/hanzo-mcp
PYTHONPATH=../hanzo-network/src:$PYTHONPATH python examples/test_local_inference.py

# Test agent swarms
PYTHONPATH=../hanzo-network/src:$PYTHONPATH python examples/working_agent_swarm.py
```

### Key Achievements

   - No external API calls
   - 100% on-device execution

2. ✅ **Agent Swarms Ready**
   - Sequential pipelines
   - Parallel execution
   - Multi-swarm coordination

3. ✅ **CI/CD Complete**
   - Automated testing on push/PR
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Quality checks integrated

4. ✅ **E2E Integration Verified**
   - hanzo-mcp launches swarms
