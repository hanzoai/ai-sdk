# Swarm Tool V2 Test Summary

## Overview

I've created comprehensive tests for the `swarm_tool_v2.py` functionality that demonstrates how multiple Claude agents can collaborate to edit and refactor code.

## Test Files Created

1. **`tests/test_swarm/test_swarm_v2_comprehensive.py`**
   - Comprehensive test suite for swarm_tool_v2
   - Tests both with and without hanzo-agents SDK
   - Demonstrates multi-agent collaboration
   - Shows before/after code transformation

2. **`test_swarm_demo.py`**
   - Standalone demonstration script
   - Shows practical example of code refactoring
   - Multiple agents working on different aspects:
     - Code Analyzer: Identifies issues
     - Documentation Specialist: Adds docstrings
     - Type Expert: Adds type hints
     - Optimizer: Improves performance
     - Reviewer: Ensures quality

## Key Features Tested

### 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration
The test demonstrates a "tree" topology where:
```
Analyzer → [Doc Writer, Type Expert, Optimizer] → Reviewer
```

### 2. Code Transformation
Starting with poorly written code:
- No documentation
- No type hints
- Inefficient algorithms
- Poor validation

Transformed to:
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Full type annotations with TypedDict
- List comprehensions and optimized algorithms
- Proper regex email validation
- Error handling

### 3. Fallback Support
When `hanzo-agents` SDK is not available, the swarm tool:
- Falls back to the original swarm implementation
- Still provides multi-agent functionality
- Maintains compatibility

## Running the Tests

### Basic Demo (No pytest required):
```bash
python test_swarm_demo.py
```

### Full Test Suite:
```bash
pytest tests/test_swarm/test_swarm_v2_comprehensive.py -xvs
```

### Individual Tests:
```bash
# Test with hanzo-agents
pytest tests/test_swarm/test_swarm_v2_comprehensive.py::TestSwarmV2Comprehensive::test_swarm_v2_with_hanzo_agents -xvs

# Test fallback mode
pytest tests/test_swarm/test_swarm_v2_comprehensive.py::TestSwarmV2Comprehensive::test_swarm_v2_fallback_mode -xvs

# Test network topologies
pytest tests/test_swarm/test_swarm_v2_comprehensive.py::TestSwarmV2Comprehensive::test_swarm_v2_network_topologies -xvs
```

## Results

The demonstration successfully shows:
- ✓ Multiple agents collaborating on code refactoring
- ✓ Each agent specializing in specific improvements
- ✓ Proper handling when hanzo-agents is not available
- ✓ Clear before/after comparison
- ✓ Verification of all improvements

## Code Quality Improvements Demonstrated

1. **Documentation**: Module and function docstrings with Args/Returns
2. **Type Safety**: Complete type hints using typing module
3. **Performance**: List comprehensions, better algorithms
4. **Data Structures**: TypedDict for structured data
5. **Validation**: Proper regex for email validation
6. **Error Handling**: Raises ValueError for invalid inputs

This comprehensive test demonstrates the power of swarm_tool_v2 for orchestrating multiple AI agents to collaborate on complex code refactoring tasks.
