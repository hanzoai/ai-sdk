"""Agent Grinding Pattern Demo.

This demonstrates the pattern where agents can launch with all normal tools,
read/research/study then decide to edit or not. You can fuzzy match things,
and just throw matches at agent grinder, let them grind through each until
it's all resolved.

The idea is that agents autonomously:
1. Search for relevant files/patterns
2. Study the code to understand context
3. Decide if changes are needed
4. Make precise edits if necessary
5. Move to the next match

This is efficient because:
- Agents work in parallel on different files
- Each agent has full context and tools
- They can skip files that don't need changes
- They make surgical edits when needed
