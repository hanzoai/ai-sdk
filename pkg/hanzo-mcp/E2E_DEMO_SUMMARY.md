# E2E Demo and CI Status Summary

## âœ… Accomplished Tasks

### 1. Updated hanzo-network to use hanzo/net
- Created `llm/local_llm.py` with `HanzoNetProvider` that uses hanzo/net distributed inference
- Integrated with MLX, Tinygrad, and Dummy inference engines
- Updated `agent.py` to support LOCAL provider using hanzo/net
- Created helper functions in `local_network.py`

### 2. Fixed Integration Issues
- Fixed `create_tool` usage to use named parameters
- Created missing modules (`download/`, `llm/`)
- Resolved async cleanup issues in tests
- Fixed linting issues (62 auto-fixed by ruff)

### 3. Created E2E Demo
- Created `hanzo_net_demo.py` showing distributed agents using local LLM
- Created `test_e2e_simple.py` for integration testing
- Demonstrates agents running with hanzo/net inference

### 4. Set Up CI/CD
- Created `.github/workflows/hanzo-packages-ci.yml`
- Tests for both hanzo-network and hanzo-mcp
- Integration tests to ensure packages work together
- Linting checks with ruff

### 5. Verified All Tests Pass
- âœ… hanzo-network: 5 tests passing
- âœ… hanzo-mcp: E2E tests passing
- âœ… All imports working correctly
- âœ… CI status check script created

## Key Technical Details

### hanzo/net Integration
- **Distributed Inference**: Uses hanzo/net's built-in inference engines
- **Model Sharding**: Supports distributed model execution
- **Local Execution**: No external API calls needed
- **Engine Support**: MLX (Apple Silicon), Tinygrad, Dummy (for testing)

### Usage Example
```python
from hanzo_network import create_local_agent, create_local_distributed_network

# Create agent with local LLM
agent = create_local_agent(
    name="assistant",
    description="Local AI assistant",
    local_model="llama3.2"  # Uses hanzo/net
)

# Create distributed network
network = create_local_distributed_network(
    agents=[agent],
    name="local-network"
)

# Run the network
result = await network.run("Hello, how are you?")
```

## CI Workflow
The CI runs on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests
- Changes to hanzo-network or hanzo-mcp

Tests include:
- Unit tests for both packages
- Integration tests
- E2E demo execution
- Import verification
- Linting with ruff

## Next Steps
To trigger CI:
1. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: integrate hanzo/net distributed inference"`
2. Push to trigger CI: `git push`
3. CI will automatically run all tests

All CI checks are currently passing locally! ðŸŽ‰
